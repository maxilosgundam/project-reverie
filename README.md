# Project Reverie
A social interactive fiction platform.

Project Reverie is an open-sourced web application designed to be a social interactive fiction platform(roleplaying) for users(roleplayers) to create, interact, and immerse themselves in written worlds of their own design. 

Users will be able to create 'sandbox'-inspired RP worlds by incorporating the use of forum thread structures redesigned as modular RP location hierarchies, entering each world as their defined characters and collaborating with other roleplayers to make meaningful stories and experiences.

The web application is currently built on a MERN architecture(MongoDB, Express, Javascript, ReactJS).
